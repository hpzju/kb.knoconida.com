## Introduction

### Perspective

- When we're talking about algorithm, the implicit contexts includes computing system and store system are based on as-is computer architecture, IC based 0-1 logic.
- Data structure also is a implicit context for algorithm.
- Algorithm should include these contexts, because algorithms' invention and implementation rely on these context.
- Algorithm narration usually don't include implicit contexts, for simplicity and consistancy reason.

### Computing Complexity

- Time Complexity
  - Big-O Notation
    - constants don't matter
    - smaller terms don't matter
    - arithmetic operations are constant
    - assignment is constant
    - accessing element in indexable object is constant
- Space Complexity
  - Auxiliary Space Complexity
    - inputs space don't count
    - primitives are considered as constant space
