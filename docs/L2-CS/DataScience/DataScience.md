## Theories

### CAP

- Consistancy
- Availability
- Partition Tolerance

- CAP: It is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance

### ACID

- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability

### Categories

- SQL:
  - RDBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, Oracle
  - Store: Row + Column
  - Schema on write
- NoSQL:
  - DBMS: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j, HBase
  - Store:
    - Document
    - Key-Value
    - Graph-based
  - Schema on read

## Best Practices

### Schema Design Principle

- understand your DBMS features and limitations
- understand your APP and DATA patterns
- Balance these two facets during data modeling desicion-making process
