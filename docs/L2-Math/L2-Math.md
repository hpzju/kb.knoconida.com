### Terminologies

- Axiom

  - The Axiomatic Method
    - theorems
    - lemma
    - corollary

- Propersition: A proposition is a statement that is either true or false

  - Compound Propositions: NOT, AND, OR, XOR, Implies, IFF
  - Predicate: proposition whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables
    - Quantifiers: assertions commonly made about a predicate
      - universally quantified statement
      - existentially quantified statement
      - for-all
      - exists
  - Contrapositive
  - Conjection: proposition whose truth not determined yet

- Mathematical Proof: A mathematical proof of a proposition is a chain of logical deductions
  leading to the proposition from a base set of axioms

  - Deduction

    - contrapositive
    - converse

  - Induction
    - Ordinary Induction
      - IF P(0) is T AND $\forall n \in N, P(n) \implies P(n+1)$, Then $\forall m \in N$, P(m) is T
    - Strong Induction
      - IF P(0) is T AND $\forall n \in N$, P(0) AND P(1) $\cdots$ AND P(n) $\implies P(n+1)$, Then $\forall m \in N$, P(m) is T
